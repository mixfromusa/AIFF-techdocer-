## Types of Knowledge Bases

There are several types of knowledge bases, each with specific characteristics:

- Relational Databases: These bases organize data into tables and support structured queries.
- Object-Oriented Databases: Store information in objects, suitable for complex data structures.
- Graph Databases: Store data as nodes and edges, ideal for representing relationships.
- Semantic and Ontological Knowledge Bases: Use ontologies to organize knowledge, often used in expert systems.
- Rule-Based Systems: Utilize a set of if-then rules for decision-making.

## Types Suitable for AI
For AI applications, the following types of knowledge bases are particularly useful:

- Graph Databases: Ideal for handling complex, interconnected data, such as in recommendation systems.
- Semantic and Ontological Knowledge Bases: Provide deep understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly for tasks involving natural language processing.
- Rule-Based Systems: Effective for decision-making and automation, often used in expert systems.

These types of knowledge bases support the needs of AI systems by managing complex data relationships and facilitating decision-making processes.
