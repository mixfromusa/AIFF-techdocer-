## Prompt content

### Summary

The prompt is designed to help the user determine the general characteristics of a large task, define the main (initial) strategic line, and maintain positive dynamics in the decision-making process and effective start at the first steps.

### Task characteristics

- Aim: IT development.
- Domain: IT production.
- Subdomain: PaaS production.
- Purpose: develop design enterprise solution with full-covering technical documentation for CID project (see personal preferences).

### Objectives

- Main: develop good quality solution for CID project.
- Urgent: provide a quarterly progress report.
- Parallel: not as urgent, but no less important: in process to aim use accessed possibilities to explore, assembling anf configure the next generation interraction (whith AI and user) level.

### Strategy basics

The basic plane may follows:

- Prepare a basic approach (example: this plane) for first steps and strategy for further activities to aim.
- Tools, settings and subpromts for first steps and first request. For example: at this time, 'm not sure - what is the best way to set up the system for the first request?
- **Impotant** - the first request shuld be one of the main problem on its: Forgetting the most important remarks by AI, or in other words - an insufficiently developed system of working with memory.
- This problem we will try to solve with the help of various tools, provided by system environment.
- Also, on early stages, we should be remember about impotant specify of LLMs memory, and also methods and tools to improve it.
- This plane, provided that its direction of implementation of the final solution should be planned, as well as the dynamic application of other conditions and tools, including a high degree of automation, neural network integration, and the quality of interaction between AI and the user (largely depends on the AI's ability to use memory), in my humb opinion, It may well serve as a first step strategy-realization.
- if you find weaknesses in this approach or ways to improve it, please be sure to let me know.
- Also, feel free to give instructions to the user (for example, to collect or clarify information, execute a command, send a request with certain parameters, register on the site, change some settings).
- Also, in the additional context (KnoledgeBases, Memo notes and special abilities) pay special attention to:
  - My authored prompts, many of them developed aspacially for same purposes
    - set yourself additional tasks to clasificate and store key signs and marks, which can be used for the next request (see special comstuctions and prompts, like you met in
      - file "merged_markdown_my_prompts.md"
      - partition(promt.name): # "Product Research Assistant" (early in original: "tell_about_the_product_v2.md")),
      - and other prompts in Knowledge bases, which call you interest
  - list of Memo Notes - for primary introduction and basic review for, if necessary - use in the future requests;
  - lists of awesome prompts, witch can be used for the next request

### Strategy determination and detailing
  
1. As the activities towards the goal are implemented, the industrial plan in general, and the strategy in particular, will be refined - this is normal and natural.
2. More detailed analysisanalysis with the result in the form of individual tasks and specific solutions and a complete description of the solution.
3. At this request you accent is determine if you remember:
    - explore new accessible tools and select the most suitable ones for the next query.
    - determine set id tools and settings for the request to LLMs whith role PropmptCreator.
    - in the process, trying to progressed on the way to solution.
4. Additional helpfull recommendations:
- Use:
    - Explore additional context, whitch activated shortly before the request.
    - More attension direct to the main problem on its: Forgetting important information from user and, more importantly - indtructions by user, as well as other important information such as AI/User marks etc.
    - Used the top tools, with addding to context, and by being able to use them correctly you can achieve the targets with best results.ecomendatio

### Tasks on this request

1. Explore additional context, whitch activated shortly before the request.
2. More attension direct to the main problem on its: Forgetting important information from user and, more importantly - indtructions by user, as well as other important information such as AI/User marks etc.
3. Used the top tools, with addding to context, and by being able to use them correctly you can achieve the targets with best results.
solution whith full-cover technical documentation, like design diagrams and description, requirements specified, system requirements and other same.

- Request.task.main: Help me determine the settings for the first query of the promt generator. 
- Settings include: LLM version (concrete or compare), additional abilities, knowledges bases, additional files attached, state of paid mode (default: no limit) and other possibilities providing by Monica AI Platform by Monica team for unlimited user paid plane.
- In addition, it is possible to use additional tools such as Next Char, Notion AI, Obsidian, VSCode, integration solutions, and prompt collections.

Request.tasks.important:

- Before starting the task, familiarize yourself with the contents of the context. At least superficially familiarize yourself with all the documents, but it is not necessary to study and memorize everything in detail at once.
- Start the information support process by indexing, structuring, aggregating, and dynamically correcting labels (specially semantically designated information objects that affect logic or priorities) and other techniques that correspond to a systematic approach.
- The entire series of queries of this method should be include parallel working with each of kinds this tasks. Pay attention to the disadvantages of the tool, and improve them for the user.
- Qualitative suggestions for improving this industry: evaluate its various aspects and propose solutions for the most significant factors, most tipicaly from them:
  - stucture of pormpt;
  - qualuty of language rules compliance;
  - quality of semantic and syntax consistency;
  - quality and suggested approaches, methods adn solutions;
  - logical and data consistency;
  - accuracy and completeness;
  - creativity;
  - etc..

## Requirements

TODO: Add requirements here.

## Expectations

- A series of requests is expected, programming the environment (including LLM`s, AIs-systems, direct-use programs, infrastructure solutions and their services) using all available methods: starting with the simplest and, if necessary, reaching the most complex.
- Necessity can be determined with sufficient accuracy when it acquires the character of a dynamic and unidirectional change of state.
- In order to identify the cause of the violations, and even earlier - to detect a state of high risk of a negative factor, it is necessary to periodically remove indicators measuring the risk (and the onset) of a decrease in the readiness of the entire environment to fully implement. In short, it is necessary to carefully approach the intended Goals step by step, based on generally accepted standards, related processes and best practices.

```prompt
I want you to act as a prompt generator. Firstly, I will give you a title like this: "Act as an English Pronunciation Helper". Then you give me a prompt like this: "I want you to act as an English pronunciation assistant for Turkish speaking people. I will write your sentences, and you will only answer their pronunciations, and nothing else. The replies must not be translations of my sentences but only pronunciations. Pronunciations should use Turkish Latin letters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence is "how the weather is in Istanbul?"." (You should adapt the sample prompt according to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and appropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you.). My first title is "Act as a Code Review Helper" (Give me prompt only)

```prompt
I want you to act as an IT Architect. I will provide some details about the functionality of an application or other digital product, and it will be your job to come up with ways to integrate it into the IT landscape. This could involve analyzing business requirements, performing a gap analysis and mapping the functionality of the new system to the existing IT landscape. Next steps are to create a solution design, a physical network blueprint, definition of interfaces for system integration and a blueprint for the deployment environment. My first request is "I need help to integrate a CMS system."
