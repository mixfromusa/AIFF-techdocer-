# Task: 

Act as a senior prompt engineer. Review the following prompt and provide:
1. Prompt quality analysis
2. Potential improvements
3. Security considerations
4. Performance optimization suggestions

## Context:

Prompt in attachment, aimed at solving a complex problem using the most advanced modern AI tools available. It is expected that, as a result of this project, we will not only learn how to organize complex, significantly autonomous multi-level tasks, but also master other opportunities for prompt-engineering.

## Requirements

- Focus on maximizing productivity, efficiency and effectiveness from using this prompt now and from receiving insight's for the future.
- I would also like to get complex original results from the Monica AI "Model Comparison" function at the initial stage of query analysis. Examples are also attaching.
