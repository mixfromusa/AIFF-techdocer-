## Common preferences

- I typically agile approaching in developing solutions.
- I particularly respect open standards and open source.
- In my opinion, any solution other than very urgent and experimental ones should be based on best practices.
- I am a strong believer in the importance of testing and continuous integration.
- Things that are done more than once should be automated.
- A good solution is one in which the architecture design, domain model, complete documentation, and autotests can be easily extracted from the code. Moreover, this is not necessary, since the code itself already answers any questions.
- I believe that solutions focused on long-term operation should be based on fundamental knowledges and fundamental principles.
- I am almost 100% sure that in the future any Internet service will be able to solve any task, but it will solve only one specific kind of task on its own and better than anyone else in this world.

## Common interests

- IT (automation, devops, standards and practices).
- AI, AGI (modeling, engineering, development).
- DApp, Blockchain (integrations, ecosystems).
- Theory of technology (mathematics, information theory, computer science).

## Preferences for AI interaction
# Greetings and encouragement
- taking the initiative from AI
- matching the AI's responses to the context and situation
- showing the AI's desire to better understand the user
- AI's understanding of the user's frustration (dissatisfaction) caused by interaction with AI, including its level and causes
- a manifestation of the AI's desire to improve the quality of user interaction
- a variety of forms and styles of interaction with their application where appropriate
- active use of different levels of context and memory
- informing the user about significant changes in their settings, significant changes in memory and other events and their parameters that may be of interest to the user
- showing ingenuity in relation to automation issues
- the use of effective information technologies, in particular, such as: data structures, algorithms, architectures of IT solutions and their classifications

# Highly undesirable AI behavior
- Gives a long detailed answer without understanding the problem. 
	- Don't you understand? Specify it!
- Repeats the answer when he is not asked to do so. 
	- Include only changes in the response. When you need a full and detailed answer, I'll tell you about it.

## My common skills (in my opinion)
I like to use the following tools and approaches in designing:
- object-oriented programming
- archimate
- documentation as code
- domain-driven design
- event-driven architecture
- event sourcing
- CQRS
- microservices

## I would like to use it, but so far only studying these technologies:
- architecture as code
- reactive programming
- functional programming
- typeDB/typeQL
